# livetranslator
python code that enables live translations on any video in the form of a gui.

There are two versions:

1. liveaudiotranslator - this one is basic and uses your desktop audio and whisper to tanslate, can only be used to translate to english.
2. liveaudiotranslator_llama_multi - this one uses your desktop audio plus Ollama to translate, can be used to translate to any language.

The ollama version needs you to install Ollama from their website first and have it running in the background before launching the program.
